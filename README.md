### Module Descriptions

- **main.py**: Entry point of the application. Handles user interactions, displays menus, and orchestrates calls to other modules based on user input.
- **models.py**: Contains the `Task` class definition, representing individual tasks with attributes like title, description, due date, category, priority, tags, and recurring days.
- **todo_list.py**: Contains the `TodoList` class definition, managing the collection of tasks. Handles operations like adding, editing, deleting, viewing, filtering, reordering, setting reminders, exporting tasks, and managing persistent storage.
- **utils.py**: Includes utility functions for input validation (`get_valid_date`, `get_valid_priority`), displaying tasks (`display_tasks`), and filtering tasks (`filter_tasks`).
- **exports.py**: Handles exporting tasks to CSV and PDF formats. Utilizes the `csv` module and `fpdf` library for generating PDF files.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the application.
- **tasks.json**: Stores the tasks data persistently. This file is automatically created and managed by the application.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HubertFijolek1/todo_app.git
cd todo_app
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage project-specific dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If `fpdf` is not listed in `requirements.txt`, ensure to install it manually:

```bash
pip install fpdf
```

## Usage üíª

### Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` script using Python.

```bash
python main.py

## Exporting Tasks üì§

The application allows you to export your tasks in two formats:

### 1. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

- **Usage**: Choose the CSV export option from the menu and specify a filename (default is `tasks.csv`).
- **Example**:

    ```
    Choose export format (1 or 2): 1
    Enter CSV filename (default 'tasks.csv'): my_tasks.csv
    Tasks successfully exported to 'my_tasks.csv'.
    ```

### 2. PDF (Portable Document Format)

- **Usage**: Choose the PDF export option from the menu and specify a filename (default is `tasks.pdf`).
- **Example**:

    ```
    Choose export format (1 or 2): 2
    Enter PDF filename (default 'tasks.pdf'): my_tasks.pdf
    Tasks successfully exported to 'my_tasks.pdf'.
    ```

**Ensure that you have the `fpdf` library installed. If not, install it using:**

```bash
pip install fpdf
```

## Dependencies üì¶

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Ensure they are installed before running the application.

### Python Libraries

- **fpdf**: For exporting tasks to PDF format.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter issues with `fpdf`, install it separately:

```bash
pip install fpdf
```
